# flappy bird in terminal

works only on my linux <br />
out need ncurses library if it doesn't work idk what to tell you, make your own flappyBird idk<br />

it was painfull, had to rewrite it a lot but at least learned some things, about buffers, cool language but i think i prefer C but time to try out rust as well
