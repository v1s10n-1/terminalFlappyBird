# flappy bird in terminal

works only at least on my linux <br />
need ncurses library if it doesn't work idk what to tell you, make your own flappyBird idk<br />

it was painfull, had to rewrite it a lot but at least learned a lot, c is better in all aspects and don't @me but i'll try rust as well
